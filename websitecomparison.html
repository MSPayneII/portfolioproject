        <h2 class="section_title">Project Objective</h2>
        <p>We wanted to determine how easily navigable the Ross School of Business Website is compared to other business school websites (Columbia Business School and Stanford Graduate School of Business).</p>

        <h2 class="section_title">Research Questions</h2>
        <p>1. How confused are respondents when trying to find the Behavioral Lab page on each website?</p>
        <p>2. On average, how many points do participants fixate on when navigating to the Behavioral Lab page?</p>

        <h2 class="section_title">Project Summary</h2>
        <p>We recruited seven participants (all women), and adopted a Within-subjects study design and randomized the website order for each participant to avoid any type of presentation bias. The study was conducted in a controlled laboratory environment using a Tobii x2-60 eyetracker. Three business school behavioral lab websites were used as stimuli: Columbia, Ross and Stanford. Six measures were collected during the study:Visual attention, final number of fixation sequence, brow furrow, heatmaps, Area of interest markers and self reporting. </p>


        <h2 class="section_title">What is eye tracking?</h2>
        <p>Eye tracking is the process of capturing data about the position of the eye relative to 2D or 3D space.</p>

        <h2 class="section_title">What does eye tracking tell us?</h2>
        <p>Eye tracking gives us important information about visual processing and attention. We leveraged eye tracking data to identify the pattern of visual attention on menu options while navigating through each website. For this we focused on the fixation sequence for each participant. This allowed us to get the average fixation numbers for each website.</p>

        <h2 class="section_title">What are facial expressions?</h2>
        <p>Facial expressions are movements of the numerous muscles supplied by the facial nerve that are attached to and move the facial skin. Affectiva Affdex (the facial expressions engine we use in this study) monitors small muscular movements of specific areas of the face (also called action units) and calculates underlying facial expressions. It also calculates other attributes such as engagement – or sustained attention to the stimuli. We leveraged facial expression data to identity confusion using brow furrow during website navigation.</p>

        <h2 class="section_title">Key findings:</h2>
        <p> We determined that the Ross School of Business website was less easily navigable than the Columbia and Stanford websites. On average, participants furrowed their brow more when navigating through the Ross website than they did when viewing the other websites.This shows that on average, participants were more confused when viewing the Ross website than they were when viewing the other websites. Participants had the least fixation points when navigating through the Stanford website. Also, </p>

        <p>The survey results indicate that participants found the Columbia and Ross website were the most difficult to navigate through. In contrast, we can see that the Stanford website was consistently rated as being easier to navigate through. In addition, we can see that Stanford had the highest number of ratings of “not confused at all”. Ross had the highest number of moderately confused participants.</p>


        <h2 class="section_title">Takeaways</h2>
        <p>The use of biometrics in research adds another layer of data collection that cannot be captured when using only computer surveys. With surveys, participants may not provide genuine answers for a number of reasons. Biometrics gives researchers the ability to record subconscious, split second reactions to stimuli that can go unreported in self reports.</p>
