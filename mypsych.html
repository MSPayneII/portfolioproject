        <h2 class="section_title">Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>African Americans are 20% more likely to suffer from mental health issues compared to the general population, but there is a severe lack of mental health awareness in black communities. Individuals that may need help do not receive it for various reasons including the stigma associated with mental illness,lack of providers from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds, and the cost</p>

        <h2 class="section_title">Target Audience</h2>
        <p>Black college students (undergrad, graduate or doctoral students) at the University of Michigan. The original audience was Black communities in Detroit, Michigan but the scope was too large for this project and needed to be scaled down. I switched to Black college students at UM because of my personal experience, interviews with other students and hearing their stories about campus psychological services. This demographic was easily accessible, has a high probability of smartphone use and is most likely comfortable using mobile applications </p>


        <h2 class="section_title">My Solution</h2>
        <p> My solution is to develop a mobile application that will provide users with mental health assessments, information regarding the types of mental illness/disorders and their symptoms, tips on how to cope, and phone numbers of relevant resources. The goal of the application is to help spread mental health awareness in the black community and hopefully give individuals resources to seek help if needed.</p>

        <p> I want to challenge the societal norm of mental health not being a topic of discussion in the black community. My original target audience was black communities in Detroit, Michigan, but early in the project, I decided that the scope was too broad for this course and posed several limitations (i.e., accessibility to users, implementation issues). I rethought my approach and shifted to students for the reasons specified in my problem statement.</p>

        <p> My hope is that students will use the information within the app to start a dialogue on the topic. Eventually, I would like to take what i’ve learned from this project and revisit a way to spread mental health awareness amongst communities in Detroit, Michigan.</p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Users receive a disclaimer that says information on the app is not an official diagnosis.</p>

        <h2 class="section_title">Design Philosophy</h2>

        <p> My philosophy was that the content should speak for itself and be the main focal point of the design, therefore, I chose to keep the layout plain. I wanted to incorporate affordances that users were familiar with using other applications (i.e., a menu icon, previous button icons and a minimalist layout).<p>

        <h2 class="section_title"> Design Process</h2>

        <h3 class="withinsection_title"> Sketching</h3>
        <p>During the brainstorming process I sketched 8 different ideas of ways mental health could be addressed with my target.</p><br>

        <p></p>
        <h3 class="withinsection_title"> Personas </h3>
        <p>Due to the tight deadline schedule of the project, I only able to conduct 4 user interviews. From the data gathered from those interview sessions, I was able to create 3 personas for intended users of the application and 1 antipersona. </p><br>

        <h3 class="withinsection_title"> Paper Protoype</h3>
        <p>The main tools used for the paper prototype phase of the project were pen, pencil and stencils. One Pro of this approach was it kept things simple and allowed changes to be made quickly during usability testing. Another Pro was that I drew several templates and made photo copies of them to save time. Using this approach, I only need to draw small features in the screen area rather than resketch the entire phone outline every time I needed to make a change.</p>

        <h3 class="withinsection_title"> Digital Protoype</h3>
        <p>The main tools used for mydigital prototype were the android icons listed on h​ttps://material.io/​, which is where I got my hamburger menu, close and home icons. The other tool is the web based design program Figma, which is what I used to create my digital prototype. The main pro of Figma is it is beginner friendly. I had no prior experience with the software, but was able to put together my prototype in a week and a half.</p><br>

        <h2 class="section_title">My Takeaway</h2>
        <p>This was my first design project. Starting with a broad idea and going through the design process to build a digital prototype was an enjoyable experience. The most challenging part of the experience was creating seven other solutions to my problem because it forced me to think outside of the box and weigh all options. Although the process was difficult at first, it allowed me to think of other ways that I could bring this application to larger communities in the future. Overall, I am proud of the application that I’ve created, and I wish to continue developing the application as I gain more skills</p>
